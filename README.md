## Welcome to my Sample Order Form!

This is a pure frontend dynamic Vue/VueX application that simulates a highly editable order form with a variety of validation checks added. 

It is very simple to setup locally:
1. pull down the project and open in the code editor of your choice
2. install the required npm packages by running 'npm install' in the terminal
3. Then run 'npm run serve' to start it on a local server

A live version of this application is available at: https://admiring-banach-cc25ec.netlify.app/

Things to add when I have more time:
- A dummy api to test axios calls 
- A testing framework such as Jest
- Add a mixins file that contains commonly used functions, such as validator functions

Thanks for having a look at my app, and let me know if you have any questions!
